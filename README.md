# Grokking Algorithms JavaScript

All the algorithms that I've learned to implement while reading the book **_Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People_**.

The examples were created using vanilla **JavaScript** and for testing I used **Vitest**, which I highly recommend, it's blazing fast.
